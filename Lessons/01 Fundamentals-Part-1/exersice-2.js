// Coding Challenge #2
/* Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement
GOOD LUCK */
